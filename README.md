## Information for developers and contributors

* Plugin based on one of the modification of the [jQueryTreetable](https://github.com/ludo/jquery-treetable) library.

Major differences described in [pull request](https://github.com/ludo/jquery-treetable/pull/133).
* It redefine a default template `issues/index.html`. If you redefine it too, then you can implement several hooks
and have a same result. You can look at `lib/redmine_issues_tree/hook_listner.rb` and get list of all used hooks.
Here is a list of hooks, added by plugin:
  * `view_issues_index_header` in the top of `issues/index.html` for including js and css;
  * `view_issues_index_contextual` in contextual area for additional links in the top of issues table;
  * `view_issues_tree_index_contextual` for same purpose, but on a tree view page.
